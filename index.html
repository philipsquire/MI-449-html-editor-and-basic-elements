<h3>Qualifications</h3>

<p>These qualifications are why I am, in fact, the best choice for "Chief Execuctive Slacker" at Speedwagon Foundation:</p>

<ul>
    <li>I can use the Ripple (referred to as "Hamon" in some dialects)! This is very imporantant under the threat of vampires.</li>
    <li>I can predict what people are going to say next!</li>
    <li>I have perfected the art of the secret Joestar technique of running away!</li>
    <li>I bluffed an all powerful vampire into being launched into space!</li>
    <li>I always find a way to do what other people say is impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've worked with the Speedwagon Foundation before, and I will do it again!</p>
